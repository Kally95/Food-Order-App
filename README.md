# ReactFood

A basic food ordering application built with React as part of my learning journey. This project demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management with Context API, and handling user interactions in a simple yet complete food ordering flow.

## Features

- **Meal Listing:** Browse a list of available meals with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Cart Management:** Add meals to the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
- **Checkout Process:** Fill out a checkout form with validation, submit orders, and clear the cart upon successful submission.
- **Order Confirmation:** View a success modal once your order is processed.
- **Responsive Design:** Basic responsive layouts with modals and interactive elements.

## Built With

- **React:** For building a dynamic, component-based user interface.
- **Context API:** To manage global state (cart, meal data) across components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Modern Java
